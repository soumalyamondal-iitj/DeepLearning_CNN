Part 1: Dataset Preparation (5)
1. MNIST Dataset
- Load and visualize the MNIST dataset,
- Preprocess the data by normalizing the pixel values to the range.
2. **Custom Dataset**:
- Download the Caltech-101 dataset
- Visualize and preprocess the custom dataset like the MNIST dataset.
Part 2: CNN Architecture (5)
1. **Basic CNN Model**:
- Construct a simple CNN model with the following architecture:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts input images.
- **Convolutional Layer 1**: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel size, ReLU activation. - **Pooling Layer 1**: Max Pooling with a 2x2 window.
    
- **Convolutional Layer 2**: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel size, ReLU activation. - **Pooling Layer 2**: [Custom choice, see Part 3].
- **Fully Connected Layer**: 128 units, ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for classification.
2. **Training and Evaluation**:
- Train the CNN model on both the MNIST dataset and your custom dataset.
- Use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer.
- Evaluate the model’s performance and report Top 1 and Top 5 accuracy.
-Explore the change in accuracy metric with different loss functions and optimizers
Part 3: Pooling Variations (5)
1. **Task**:
- Implement two different pooling strategies for the second pooling layer in the CNN:
- **Option A**: Max Pooling (2x2 window).
- **Option B**: Average Pooling (2x2 window).
- Train and compare the CNN’s performance using both pooling methods on the MNIST dataset and your custom dataset.
2. **Analysis**:
- Compare the training accuracy, validation accuracy, and loss curves for both pooling methods.
- Discuss the impact of each pooling strategy on the model’s performance and convergence speed.
Part 4: Feature Map Visualization (5)
1. **Task**:
- Visualize the feature maps generated by the first and second convolutional layers for both the MNIST and custom datasets.
- Select one image from each class in the datasets and pass it through the trained CNN models.
- Visualize and compare the feature maps at different levels (after the first convolutional layer and after the second convolutional layer).
